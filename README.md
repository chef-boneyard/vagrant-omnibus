# vagrant-omnibus

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/vagrant-omnibus.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-omnibus) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef/vagrant-omnibus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef/vagrant-omnibus) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/chef/vagrant-omnibus.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/chef/vagrant-omnibus) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/chef/vagrant-omnibus.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/chef/vagrant-omnibus)

A Vagrant plugin that ensures the desired version of Chef is installed via the platform-specific Omnibus packages. This proves very useful when using Vagrant with provisioner-less baseboxes OR cloud images.

The plugin should work correctly with most all providers that hook into `Vagrant::Action::Builtin::Provision` for provisioning and is known to work with the following [Vagrant providers](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/index.html):

- VirtualBox (part of core)
- AWS (ships in [vagrant-aws](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-aws) plugin)
- Rackspace (ships in [vagrant-rackspace](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant-rackspace) plugin)
- VMWare Fusion (can be [purchased from Hashicorp](https://www.vagrantup.com/vmware/))
- LXC (ships in [vagrant-lxc](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-lxc))
- OpenStack (ships in [vagrant-openstack-plugin](https://github.com/cloudbau/vagrant-openstack-plugin))
- Digital Ocean (ships in [vagrant-digitalocean](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-digitalocean))
- Parallels Desktop (ships in [vagrant-parallels](https://github.com/yshahin/vagrant-parallels))

## Installation

Ensure you have downloaded and installed Vagrant 1.1 or newer from the [Vagrant downloads page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). If you require Windows support then Vagrant 1.6.1 or newer is needed.

For Vagrant 1.5 or newer, run:

```console
$ vagrant plugin install omnibus
```

For older versions of Vagrant, you will need to prepend `vagrant-`.

```console
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
```

## Usage

The Omnibus Vagrant plugin automatically hooks into the Vagrant provisioning middleware. You specify the version of the Chef Omnibus package you want installed using the `omnibus.chef_version` config key. The version string should be a valid Chef release version or `:latest`.

Install the latest version of Chef:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.omnibus.chef_version = :latest

  ...

end
```

Install a specific version of Chef:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.omnibus.chef_version = "11.4.0"

  ...

end
```

Specify a custom install script:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.omnibus.install_url = 'http://acme.com/install.sh'
  # config.omnibus.install_url = 'http://acme.com/install.msi'
  # config.omnibus.install_url = '/some/path/on/the/host'

  ...

end
```

If [vagrant-cachier](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier) is present and `config.cache.auto_detect` enabled the downloaded omnibus packages will be cached by vagrant-cachier. In case you want to turn caching off:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.omnibus.cache_packages = false

  ...

end
```

This plugin is also multi-vm aware so it would possible to say install a different version of Chef on each VM:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  config.vm.define :new_chef do |new_chef_config|

    ...

    new_chef_config.omnibus.chef_version = :latest

    ...

  end

  config.vm.define :old_chef do |old_chef_config|

    ...

    old_chef_config.omnibus.chef_version = "10.24.0"

    ...

  end
end
```

## Tests

### Unit

The unit tests can be run with:

```
rake test:unit
```

The test are also executed by Travis CI every time code is pushed to GitHub.

### Acceptance

Currently this repo ships with a set of basic acceptance tests that will:

- Provision a Vagrant instance.
- Attempt to install Chef using this plugin.
- Perform a very basic chef-solo run to ensure Chef is in fact installed.

The acceptance tests can be run against a subset of the Vagrant providers listed above. The acceptance tests can be run with:

```
rake test:acceptance:PROVIDER_NAME
```

And as expected, all acceptance tests only uses provisioner-less baseboxes and cloud images!
